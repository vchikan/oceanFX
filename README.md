Labview Driver for Ocean FX spectrometer
A LabVIEW Solution: I had the same as problem as above obtaining high speed data from Ocean FX spectrometer using omnidriver. I decided to implement the known OBP protocol in Labview for controlling and reading data from the Ocean FX spectrometer directly via the USB port. I had written a small driver to replace the WinUSB driver with mine to read and write the USB port Labview Visa. Step 1. Replace the WinUSB driver with the OceanFX driver. Step 2 run the simple spectrometer VI to see if there is communication. The save high speed data into binary allows triggered high-speed acquisition from Ocean FX spectrometer. The analysis file provided will convert and graph the saved binary data. I was able to get around 4kHz data rate with Labview. Enjoy!
